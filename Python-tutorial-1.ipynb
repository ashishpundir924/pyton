In short, it means that operators such as +, -. *, %, and so on, may represent different operations according to the context they are used in. It doesn't make any sense to sum two lists, right? Therefore, the + sign is used to concatenate them. Hence, the * sign is used to concatenate the list to itself according to the right operand."

Notice how in the dictionary, the second occurrence of the 'l' key (the one with value 3), overwrites the first one (the one with value 2).

This feature has received such a welcome from the community that in 3.7 it has become a legit feature of the language rather than an implementation side effect.

    "All these methods are quite simple to understand, but it's worth talking about that None, for a moment. Every function in Python returns None, unless the return statement is explicitly used to return something else, but we'll see this when we explore functions. None is frequently used to represent the absence of a value, and it is quite commonly used as a default value for arguments in function declaration. Some inexperienced coders sometimes write code that returns either False or None. Both False and None evaluate to False in a Boolean context so it may seem there is not much difference between them. But actually, I would argue there is quite an important difference: False means that we have information, and the information we have is False. None means no information. And no information is very different from information that is False. In layman's terms, if you ask your mechanic, Is my car ready?, there is a big difference between the answer, No, it's not (False) and, I have no idea (None).\n",

    "A namedtuple is a tuple-like object that has fields accessible by attribute lookup as well as being indexable and iterable (it's actually a subclass of tuple). This is sort of a compromise between a full-fledged object and a tuple, and it can be useful in those cases where you don't need the full power of a custom object, but you want your code to be more readable by avoiding weird indexing. Another use case is when there is a chance that items in the tuple need to change their position after refactoring, forcing the coder to refactor also all the logic involved, which can be very tricky. As usual, an example is better than a thousand words (or was it a picture?). Say we are handling data about the left and right eyes of a patient. We save one value for the left eye (position 0) and one for the right eye (position 1) in a regular tuple. Here's how that might be:"
